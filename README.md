Wraith is a screenshot comparison tool, created by developers at BBC News.


## What is it?

Wraith uses either [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) or
[SlimerJS](http://slimerjs.org) to create screen-shots of different environments
and then creates a diff of the two images, the affected areas are highlighted in
blue

## Requirements

Imagemagick and PhantomJS are required to use Wraith, install via your favourite package manager.  To read our detailed instructions for setup and install, as well as example configs, visit [wraith docs](http://bbc-news.github.io/wraith/index.html)

```sh
brew install phantomjs  
brew install imagemagick
```

## Installation

Open terminal and run

    gem install wraith

You can then run the following to create a template snap.js and config file:

    wraith setup

Alternatively you can clone the repo.

    git clone https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith
    cd wraith
    bundle install

## Using Wraith
You can type `wraith` into terminal to bring up the list of commands, but the one to start Wraith is

```sh
wraith capture config_name
```

This assumes that your snap.js and config.yaml are in the folders that were created on setup. To run the setup, create a folder and inside run

```sh
wraith setup
```

### CLI

There are other commands also available, these all expect a config_name to be passed as an option. Wraith will look for the config file at `configs/[config_name].yaml`.  

```sh
  wraith capture [config_name]              # A full Wraith job
  wraith compare_images [config_name]       # compares images to generate diffs
  wraith crop_images [config_name]          # crops images to the same height
  wraith generate_gallery [config_name]     # create page for viewing images
  wraith generate_thumbnails [config_name]  # create thumbnails for gallery
  wraith history [config_name]              # Setup a baseline set of shots
  wraith latest [config_name]               # Capture new shots to compare with baseline
  wraith multi_capture [filelist]           # A Batch of Wraith Jobs
  wraith reset_shots [config_name]          # removes all the files in the shots folder
  wraith save_images [config_name]          # captures screenshots
  wraith setup                              # creates config folder and default config
  wraith setup_folders [config_name]        # create folders for images
```

## Output

After each screenshot is captured, the compare task will run, this will output a diff.png and a data.txt.  The data.txt for each file will show the number of pixels that have changed.  There is a main data.txt which is in the root of the output folder that will combine all of these values to easier view all the pixel changes.

## Gallery

A gallery is available to view each of the images and the respective diff images located in the shots folder once all the images have been compared.

## History usage

In Wraith 2.0 we introduced a new way for using Wraith in development and testing, historical shots.  Rather than capture 2 domains, you capture 1 domain, probably your local copy of the latest code, then later on after development is in progress, run Wraith again to compare.  This makes working against an isolated dev environment much easier as you wont need an internet connection.  

The usage is different in that you need 1 domain in your config and you will need to set a historical shots folder.  You will need to specify a `history_dir` in addition to the `directory` key in your `config.yml` file. An example of this can be found in the [`history.yaml`](https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith/blob/31406956bfc465d087f1d40304630e18dc0f857e/configs/history.yaml#L9-L11) file of the `configs` directory of this repository.  The way this works is that shots are captured as normal with the history command below.  This will create 2 folders with the labels you have specified in the config file, for example, shots and shots_history.  The original shots will be copied into your 'history' folder, then copied back into the shots folder once you have run your latest job.  This workflow will essentially mean your history folder is your baseline, being copied back into the shots folder every time you run the 'latest command'

```sh
wraith history history.yaml
```
After some development, run the latest command
```sh
wraith latest history.yaml
```
You will now be able to run the latest command over and over without having to do clear up.

## Docker
At BBC, we use Docker and AWS in our workflow.  The Dockerfile is in the repo, but you can pull from the registry here`docker pull bbcnews/wraith`.  There is no quick way to get up and running with OSX and no way to use it on Windows.  For a CI environment, it has a really good use case though.  To run, specify your workspace and the command you want.  If you want to use the Ruby AWS-SDK gem to upload your images to s3, it is built into the container.  I recommend writing a simple ruby script that runs once you have completed a Wraith run.

```sh
docker run -d bbcnews/wraith -w /wraith -v path/to/dir:/wraith capture configs/config.yaml
```

## Changelog - updated 2014-10-15
Added Dockerfile and updated Readme with example usage.

## Selenium-Wraith

Anyone interested in integrating selenium capability with Wraith should check out
Selenium-Wraith by Andrew Tekle-Cadman of Future Visible.

Selenium-Wraith was forked from the BBC repo on 16/04/14 and adds the following capabilities to Wraith

1. Selenium integration, both running locally on a desktop or on a selenium grid
2. Browser to browser screenshot comparison
3. Page component-based comparison

You can check out Andrew's Project on GitHub here:
